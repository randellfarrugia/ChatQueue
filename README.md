# ChatQueue

This solution contains two projects. 

- QueueAPI
- ChatApplication

### QueueAPI

This project acts as an API endpoint which contains methods to populate agent data for all the different teams and also provide a way to initiate the chat session.
Included with this project there is a swagger documentation which will allow you to test out the different endpoints

### Chat Application

This project is a class library which handles all the logic in regards to the addition of data, initiation of requests and monitoring of chat sessions.
